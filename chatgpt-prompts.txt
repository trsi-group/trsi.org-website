build a website for the demo scene group Tristar & Red Sector Inc. using bootstrap.
it should work on mobile, tables and desktop.
colors are black background, footer dark grey, everything else in pastel colors close to the commodore c64 palette.
assign proper tag ID to each section we are going to create, so we can modify them afterwards.

we don't need a header.
at the top, there is a section with 5 columns of text, covered by a large image in the background.

next section are card tiles, 3 columns with 5 rows each. card tiles have a clickable image at top, and a text underneath.
images are hidden first, and only show up when reaching the viewport (1 sec delay)
each image has small margins and slightly increases in size when hovering over it.
as images you can reference any TRSI demo image you can find, and add the correct text to it.

last section is a footer, with 2 columns for links, 3 rows each.

go for it and give me the code.
